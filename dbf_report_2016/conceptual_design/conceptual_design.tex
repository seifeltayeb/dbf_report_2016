\subsection{Scoring Outline} \label{sec:scoring_outline}
In order to understand the sensitivities of the score, the scoring formulae and the missions associated with them need to be studied. The total team score is given by

\begin{equation}
\text{Total Score} = \frac{\text{Written Report Score} \times \text{Total Mission Score}}{\text{RAC}}
\end{equation}

where \textit{RAC} is the Rated Aircraft Cost. 
%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Rated Aircraft Cost}
%
Reducing $RAC$ is one of the means of achieving a higher score, as it divides the product of Report Score and Total Mission score. RAC can be calculated using the formula
%
\begin{equation}
    \text{RAC} = \text{EW}_{1} \times \text{Wt}_{\textrm{Battery 1}} \times \text{N}_{\text{comp}} + \text{EW}_{2} \times \text{Wt}_{\textrm{Battery 2}}
\end{equation}
%
where $\text{EW}_{1}$ is weight of the PA ready to fly but without payload, $\text{Wt}_{\textrm{Battery 1}}$ is battery weight for PA, $\text{N}_{\text{comp}}$ is number of sub-assemblies the PA is broken into for the delivery flight(s), $\text{EW}_{2}$ is weight of MSA ready to fly but without a payload and $\text{Wt}_{\textrm{Battery 2}}$ is battery weight for MSA

%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Total Mission Score}

Total mission score is given by
%
\begin{gather}
    \textrm{Total Mission Score} = \text{MF}_{1} \times \text{MF}_{2} \times \text{PF} + \textrm{Bonus}
\end{gather}
%
where $\text{MF}_{1}$ and $\text{MF}_{2}$ are scores for the MSA flight missions, $\text{PF}$ is score for PA flight mission and $\textrm{Bonus}$ is bonus task score for PA ground mission. All flight missions require takeoff within the prescribed field length and a successful landing(s). The components of total mission score are as follows

\paragraph{MSA Arrival Flight, $\text{MF}_{1}$}

The first mission requires MSA to takeoff, fly 3 laps without a payload around the competition course within 5 minutes and land. The score from the mission is $\text{MF}_{1} = 2.0$ if the mission is completed else the score is $\text{MF}_{1} = 0.1$. The competition course layout is shown in Figure \ref{fig:course}.
%

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{course.pdf}
    \caption{Layout of the competition course}
    \label{fig:course}
\end{figure}
%

\paragraph{MSA Delivery Flight, $\text{MF}_{2}$}

The second mission requires MSA to carry PA sub-assemblies around the course. One or more parts of PA can be carried in a single flight. The MSA has to takeoff, fly one lap and land for each sub-assembly delivery flight. After landing MSA has to taxi to a payload loading area where the installed sub-assembly is removed and new sub-assembly is loaded if required. This is repeated until all PA sub-assemblies have been delivered. All PA parts need to be carried internally and the mission has to be completed within 10 minutes. The score for the mission is $\text{MF}_{2} = 4.0$ if all sub-assembly delivery flights are successfully completed, $\text{MF}_{2} = 1.0$ if at least one sub-assembly group is successfully delivered and $\text{MF}_{2} = 0.1$ if none of the above. If a partial score is received ($\text{MF}_{2} = 1.0$), the aircraft can attempt a single retry of the mission. 

\paragraph{PA Flight, $\text{PF}$}

Third mission uses PA to fly a single \SI{32}{oz} \textit{Gatorade} bottle of any flavour 3 laps around the course within 5 minutes. The payload must be carried internally. Approximate specifications of the payload are: height \SI{8.2}{in} (\SI{20.8}{\centi\meter}), maximum diameter \SI{3.7}{in} (\SI{9.4}{\centi\meter}) and mass \SI{2}{lb} \SI{3.9}{oz} (\SI{1020}{\gram}). The payload can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:gatorade}.
%
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[angle=270, width=0.5\textwidth]{gatorade.jpg}
    \caption{\SI{32}{oz} \textit{Gatorade} bottle used as the payload for mission 3}
    \label{fig:gatorade}
\end{figure}
%
A score of $\text{PF} = 2.0$ will be awarded for completing all mission objectives. If PA flies less than the required number of laps or exceeds the time limit, $\text{PF} = 1.0$ is awarded. In case of no flight attempt or a complete successful flight, $\text{PF} = 0.1$ is used.  If a partial score is received ($\text{PF} = 1.0$), the aircraft can attempt a single retry of the mission. 

\paragraph{Bonus Mission}

Bonus mission requires the team to assemble PA from its sub-assemblies within 2 minutes. This includes installing and securing the payload. The mission can only be attempted if MSA successfully completed mission 2 ($\text{MF}_{2} = 4.0$). The aircraft will receive a score of $\text{Bonus} = 2.0$ if PA is assembled in the given time and passes the wing tip test and control systems check. Else $\text{Bonus} = 0.0$

\subsection{Configuration Selection}

%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%

Mission 3 requires PA to carry the specified payload internally. Thus the team decided to design the fuselage to follow the shape of the payload as closely as possible to reduce the dimensions and the mass of the aircraft. On the other hand, the main purpose of MSA is to carry the sub-assemblies of PA internally around the competition course in mission 2. Thus the driving factor in fuselage selection for MSA is to fit the PA sub-assemblies into MSA with minimum structural requirements.

From sensitivity analysis, it was concluded that two flights in mission 2, carrying PA in two separate sub-assemblies would provide the highest score. Therefore to minimise the mass of MSA, the two PA sub-assemblies should be of similar mass and dimensions. This approach avoids wasting internal volume of MSA and makes sure that MSA payload requirement is as low as possible. The heavier piece would be carried first to take advantage of a fresh battery pack and make the second takeoff with partially discharged batteries less demanding.

Flying wing configuration was initially considered since it would provide efficient use of volume when one flying wing is place inside another one. However the advantage over a conventional design was analysed to be far less if the aircraft can be split into two components because the wing/landing gear group and the fuselage/boom/tail group can be with relative ease designed to provide two slender bodies with similar dimensions and masses. Also conventional design was judged to be a less risky option.

Therefore for PA, the wing span should closely align with the overall length of the aircraft and the wing chord and landing gear height should be close to the diameter of the PA fuselage. Furthermore the horizontal and vertical tail should not reach much outside the diameter of the fuselage. The approach chosen drove the team to adopt a tail dragger landing gear since this would eliminate the need for a relatively large front landing gear. However the team was unable to locate the vertical tail upside down compared to a regular configuration due to roll angle requirements. Thus the
